A few fun facts: 
1. I have trouble coming up with these
2. See above. (Yay, I've hit the requirements of 2 "fun" facts!)
3. Banana slugs have blue blood when oxygenated, otherwise it's clear
4. The Eiffel tower is taller in the summer because heat expands the metal
5. Avacadoes are fruits because the pit is a seed 
6. Green beans and cucumbers are also fruits
7. I don't know why I know #3, #4, # 5, or #6
8. Are these facts fun enough to count yet?
9. I'm sure I could add entries about wombats, sea horses, the Great Lakes, and the St. Louis Arch among others...
10. I added this one so that there's 10 fun facts

This is a different added line.
I have removed the grammatical error in the line above.

My Goal:
1. I want to get more experience with AprilTags and maybe get them used in the competition this year.
